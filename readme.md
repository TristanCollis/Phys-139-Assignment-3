# Running the file

You can run either Assignment_3.ipynb or Assignment_3.py.  

# Outputs  

The outputs should be the same (with variation as they generate new data each time).  
Both save the histograms as png images, as should already be visible among the project files.  
Additionally, both output the analyses to the console.  
The Jupyter notebook should have the histograms visible within the file.
